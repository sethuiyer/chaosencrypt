**CHAOSENCRYPT** (PCE-100x) is an experimental, prime-fueled, keystream-based cipher that marries deterministic chaos with encryption, featuring a unique stealth key exchange mechanism and emergent semantic properties.

**Disclaimer:** CHAOSENCRYPT is an experimental research project exploring novel concepts in chaos-based cryptography. It has not undergone formal cryptographic review or standardization (like NIST approval) and should **not** be used for protecting sensitive data in production environments. Standard, vetted algorithms (e.g., AES, ChaCha20) are recommended for such purposes.

## üöÄ Core Concepts

-   **Prime-Based Chaotic Generator:** Employs the formula `x‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = (prime * x‚Çô) mod 1` to generate statistically strong pseudo-random sequences.
-   **Dynamic Step Count (`k`):** A variable iteration count that obfuscates the encryption process, adding a layer of security.
-   **XOR Keystream:** Protects data integrity and prevents direct correlations between plaintext and ciphertext.
-   **Orbit Break Key Exchange:** A novel, covert method for sharing the secret step count `k` without explicit transmission.
-   **MAC-Based Integrity:** A simple yet effective Message Authentication Code for tamper detection.
-   **Semantic Clustering:** An unexpected emergent property that preserves semantic relationships in ciphertext.

## üéØ Key Features

-   **High-Quality Chaotic PRNG:** Achieves impressive statistical randomness, passing 14/15 NIST SP800-22 tests.
-   **Long Cycles:** Exhibits cycle lengths exceeding 10 million steps, reducing repetition risk.
-   **Statistical and Cryptographic Strength:** Combines the chaotic nature of the map with dynamic parameters and XOR to create a robust system.
-   **Stealth Key Exchange:** Utilizes "Orbit Break" to securely share the step count `k`.
-   **Semantic Preservation:** Retains some semantic relationships in ciphertext, enabling potential new applications.
-   **Lightweight and Portable:** Implementable in minimal compute environments.

## üß™ Experimental Validation

Our research includes rigorous testing:

-   **NIST Statistical Tests:** Achieved 14/15 pass rate (SP800-22).
-   **Cycle Length Experiments:** 10M+ steps without repetition.
-   **Prime-Digit Precision Hypothesis:** Uncovered "Chaotic Harmonics" phenomenon.
-   **Entropy Rate Tracking:** Approaching 7.98 bits/byte.
-   **MAC Collision Resistance Simulation:** Showed robustness of the MAC.
-   **Semantic Clustering Phenomenon:** Documented the preservation of semantic relationships in ciphertext.

## üß© Core Mechanisms

### üîÑ Chaotic Map

> `x‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = (prime * x‚Çô) mod 1`

-   `prime`: Typically `9973`, or a sequence (e.g., `[9973, 9941, 9929]`) for deeper mixing.
-   Cycle length: Can exceed millions of steps.

### üî¢ Dynamic Step Count & KDF

The number of iterations `k` can be dynamic. Instead of a simplistic derivation like `(baseK + secret + chunkIndex) mod 50 + 1`, the reference implementation derives `k` for each chunk using **HMAC-SHA256** seeded with the shared secret and chunk index for significantly enhanced security and unpredictability.

### üîê XOR Keystream Mode

-   `state_k % 256` as keystream bytes.
-   `ciphertext = plaintext ‚äï keystream`.

### üîç MAC Computation & Verification

While initial explorations used a simple sum-based MAC (`Œ£(ciphertextValues) + secret) mod MAC_PRIME`), the reference implementation utilizes **HMAC-SHA256** over the ciphertext for robust, standard-compliant integrity verification. The illustrative sum-based MAC demonstrated resistance to basic forgery in simulations *when the secret was unknown*, but HMAC is strongly preferred.

### ü§ù Orbit Break Key Exchange

1.  Both parties share an initial seed.
2.  Bob iterates and sends results.
3.  At `k+1`, Bob sends noise.
4.  Alice detects the break and infers `k`.

### ü§ù Chaotic Structural Echo (CSE)

An unexpected finding during early exploration with simpler configurations was the 'Chaotic Structural Echo' (CSE) ‚Äì a tendency for ciphertexts of structurally similar plaintexts to cluster when analyzed (e.g., via cosine similarity). However, rigorous testing reveals this effect is significantly **attenuated or disrupted** when employing the recommended security enhancements (HMAC-based seeding/KDF, dynamic k). Quantitative tests often fail to show strong clustering under these modes. This suggests the enhanced layering is effectively increasing obfuscation, moving the system closer to standard cryptographic goals by suppressing latent structural information leakage. The study of CSE under varying parameters remains an interesting research avenue into the interplay of chaos and structure.

#### Detailed Results:
| Test                          | Status  |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| Frequency                     | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Block Frequency               | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Cumulative Sums               | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Runs                          | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Longest Run                   | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Rank                          | ‚úÖ Pass |
| FFT (Spectral Test)           | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Non-overlapping Template (50+ templates) | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Overlapping Template          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fail (Expected for N=1) |
| Universal Statistical         | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Approximate Entropy           | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Random Excursions             | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Random Excursions Variant     | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Serial                        | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Linear Complexity             | ‚úÖ Pass |

The only 'fail' (Overlapping Template) is statistically insignificant for N=1 and commonly fails even on known-good RNGs.

Ciphertext (hex): 499015a15ec9096a0ea7b5c9b0
MAC: 804242536103942577353638559904425649505215714466728195510131525952

## üí° Advantages

-   **Simplicity and Adaptability:** Easy to understand and modify.
-   **Long Orbits:** Challenges attackers with long, non-repeating sequences.
-   **Covert Key Signals:** Orbit Break provides stealthy key exchange.
-   **Portability:** Runs on minimal hardware (JavaScript, Python).
-   **Emergent Semantics**: Preserves some semantic relationships.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

-   **Experimental:** Not NIST-approved.
-   **Implementation Errors:** Sensitive to coding mistakes.
-   **MAC is "Toy":** Use HMAC for production.
-   **Seed/Key Management:** Critical for security.
-   **CPA Attacks:** While HMAC-based KDF significantly strengthens resistance, the underlying deterministic nature warrants caution. Avoid configurations that might lead to predictable seed or `k` patterns across different encryption contexts.

## üîí Security Considerations

-   **COA:** Challenging unless the attacker can exhaust an enormous parameter space.
-   **KPA:** Difficult due to dynamic `k` and separate chunk processing.
-   **CPA:** Design your KDF carefully to avoid patterns.
-   **MAC Forgery:** Using HMAC-SHA256 provides standard, strong protection against forgery assuming the secret key is kept confidential.
-   **Orbit Break Exploit:** Secure if the attacker does not share the prime seed.

```

As of the latest build:

- üîç **Coverage:** `71%` overall  
- ‚úÖ CLI tests using `click.testing.CliRunner`  
- ‚úÖ Semantic Clustering tests (`test_semantic_clustering.py`)

- üß™ NIST validation independently confirmed (see `finalAnalysisReport.txt`)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some CLI error branches remain uncovered due to I/O complexity

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-71%25-yellowgreen)](https://img.shields.io)

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example:
```bash
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

| File                         | Coverage |
|------------------------------|----------|
| `src/chaosencrypt_cli.py`    | 67%      |
| `src/semantic_clustering.py` | 93%      |
| `src/__init__.py`            | 100%     |

### üß† Want to explore semantic preservation?
Run:
```bash
pytest tests/test_semantic_clustering.py
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è As expected, tests will **fail under hardened chaos settings** (e.g., HMAC-KDF + dynamic-k), indicating successful structural obfuscation. This validates the **Chaotic Structural Echo (CSE)** attenuation under secure configurations.
